# Example: Nanwang · Spring Garden Edition — Finished Prompts in Four Syntax Flows

> This example demonstrates assembling the complete prompt for the same character setting (**Nanwang · Plain-Dress Garden Version v1.2**, see `sheets/CharacterAnchors.csv`) across four syntax flows. Core rule: **anchor sentences are reused verbatim across images; synonym rewriting is forbidden**.

## Character Anchor Summary (quoted from `sheets/CharacterAnchors.csv`)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Core identity anchor (≥1.6) | 16-year-old girl; faint brown 1mm mole below the left eye corner; often wears a small white daisy in the hair (1.8) |
| Core temperament tag (≥1.3) | Gentle, quiet, slightly timid, restrained body language (1.3) |
| Color scheme · primary | Light mint #A8D8C9 |
| Color scheme · secondary/accent | White (daisy, skirt-hem pattern) / faint brown (mole), light pink (lips) |
| Skin / hair / eye color | Warm white / black hair / dark brown eyes |
| Usage restrictions (negative anchoring) | No red tones / dark tones / ornate gowns |

**Scene**: spring garden · golden-hour backlight · 85mm portrait

## 1. Natural-language narrative flow (Flux / DALL-E 3 / SD3)

> Assembly order: [scene overview + shot scale] → [character anchors] → [posture & micro-expression] → [lighting & color] → [background layers]; weight brackets and plus signs forbidden; anchor sentences go at the start of the character block.

An 85mm portrait shot at eye level. 16-year-old Nanwang stands deep in a spring garden. She wears a light mint cotton plain dress with delicate white daisy embroidery on the hem. Her black straight waist-length hair falls to her waist, with a single white daisy tucked in it. A tiny, faint brown mole sits below her left eye corner. She looks at the camera with a gentle, quiet expression. Golden-hour backlighting outlines warm rims of light around her hair and dress. The foreground is a blurred patch of white daisies; the background is a breezy garden wall.

Exclusion: affirmative writing first (the dress sentence naturally excludes red dresses / leather jackets) + fallback `without heavy makeup, no other hair accessories`.

## 2. Conversational image models (GPT-4o / Gemini 2.5 Flash Image)

> Give a complete description in the first round, then make conversational single-point fixes; change only single points, never the anchor sentences.

**Round 1**: 16-year-old Nanwang, light mint cotton plain dress with white daisy embroidery, black waist-length straight hair, tiny faint brown mole below the left eye, one white daisy in the hair, spring garden, golden-hour backlight, 85mm half-body portrait.

**Fix round**: make the mole smaller and fainter; keep the dress mint green, not blue.

## 3. Mixed Tag + parameter flow (Midjourney v6 / Niji v6)

> Core anchors within the first 20 tokens; the mid-section stacks shot scale and lighting; append CLI parameters uniformly at the end.

```
A 16yo girl Nanwang, faint brown mole under left eye, single white daisy in hair, light mint green plain dress, black waist-length straight hair, rule of thirds composition, 85mm portrait shot, side-backlighting, golden hour glow, spring garden, shallow depth of field --ar 3:4 --cref https://example.com/nanwang.png --cw 100 --style cute --niji 6
```

`--no` filters only the 4-5 highest-risk words: `--no heavy makeup, red dress, short hair, dark lighting`

## 4. Weighted Tag flow (Stable Diffusion 1.5 / XL / SD3)

> Assembly order (v2.2): identity anchors (1.5+) → core features (1.3-1.5) → posture/composition → lighting/atmosphere (0.7-0.9).

```
(16yo girl Nanwang:1.2), (mole under left eye:1.5), (single white daisy in hair:1.3), (light mint green plain dress:1.4), (black waist-length straight hair:1.2), rule of thirds, 85mm portrait shot, side-backlighting, golden hour, spring garden, soft bokeh, masterwork, high quality
```

Negative Prompt box: `(deformed hands, bad anatomy, extra fingers, missing fingers:1.4), (mole under right eye, heavy makeup, red dress, short hair:1.3), (blurry, low quality, watermark, text:1.2)`
